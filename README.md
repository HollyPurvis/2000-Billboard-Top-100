This R program extracts data from the billboards package and allows users to select an artist whose songs have appeared in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The program then generates a graph to visualize the ranking of the selected artist's songs, using various packages from the tidyverse suite (including tidyr, dplyr, glue, and stringr).
